# 1/2019 Right to rectification request to a healthcare group

**(Applicable Law — GDPR & Data Protection Act 2018)**  

We received a complaint against a healthcare group arising from its refusal of a request for rectification under Article 16 of the GDPR. The complainant alleged that the healthcare group was incorrectly spelling his name on its computer system by not including the síneadh fada, an accent that forms part of the written Irish language.  

Hospitals under the administration of this healthcare group use a patient administration system to initially record patient data which is then shared with other systems at later points of patient care, i.e. Laboratory, Radiology and Cardiology. The healthcare group informed the complainant that it is not possible to record the síneadh fada because syntax characters are recorded as commands on the PAS, impacting on the way data is stored and processed.

The healthcare group informed the DPC that the patient administration system is due to be replaced in 2019/2020. However, the group’s new system will not allow for the use of the síneadh fada. The healthcare group informed the DPC this was for the purpose of enabling a streamlined single point of contact for patient information across different systems. This would enable professionals to access this information across different units within a hospital or hospital group without re-entering the data at a later point, thereby avoiding potential for later errors. The other systems across the current healthcare group network and/or wider hospital network do not support the use of the síneadh fada. The healthcare group further advised the DPC that they identify patients with Patient ID numbers rather than isolated names.

The DPC examined this submission and concluded that any update of the computer system would lead to costs in terms of significant costs and time, along with errors in storage and matching of records. The DPC also engaged with An Coimisinéir Teanga (Irish Language Regulator) about its advice to public sector organisations with respect to computer systems supporting the síneadh fada. An Coimisinéir Teanga advised there is no such obligation arising from the Official Languages Act 2003 but such an obligation can arise from a language scheme — an agreement put in place between a public body and the Minister for Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht.

The DPC queried the healthcare group on the existence of a language scheme and was provided a copy. This scheme sets out a respect for patient choices regarding names, addresses and their language of choice. The scheme also provides a commitment to update computer systems to achieve “language compliancy”. There is no timeframe provided for the fulfilment of this commitment in the language scheme. The healthcare group advised the DPC they are committed to patient safety as a primary, core concern and further advised the DPC of the difficulties associated with sharing and storing information across other systems if they updated their system to allow for the use of the síneadh fada. They also advised that they will be testing the possibility of using the síneadh fada in any update of their computer system.

The DPC had regard to Article 16 and Article 5(1) (d) of the GDPR in examining this complaint. Both articles set out the rights of individuals subject to “the purposes of the processing”. The right to rectification under Article 16 of the GDPR is not an absolute right. Organisations that control or process personal data are required to take reasonable steps in the circumstances. The DPC had regard to case law from the European Court of Human Rights on linguistic rights and/or naming. This case law reflects that the spelling of names falls under the ambit of Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights but that the Court adopts a restrictive approach in this regard. As such, the DPC reiterated the purpose of the processing in the circumstances of the complaint was the administration of health care to the complainant and involved the use of Patient ID numbers. The name of the complainant  was not the isolated means of identification and therefore the purpose of the processing is being achieved without the use of diacritical marks.

The DPC had regard to any risks to the complainant in the refusal of their Article 16 request also. The DPC noted the risk to the complainant would increase because of the difficulties associated with cross-system handling of the síneadh fada and the impact this would have on any health care decision making for the individual. In the circumstances, the non-use of the síneadh fada would not constitute an interference with the fundamental rights of the individual.

Under section 109(5) (f) of the Data Protection Act 2018 (the 2018 Act), the DPC requested the healthcare group to inform the complainant of its actions in the implementation of a computer system enabled to reflect the síneadh fada. Also, the DPC requested that the group add an addendum to the individual’s file to show the síneadh fada forms part of the individual’s name.

The DPC, under section 109(5)(c) of the 2018 Act, advised the complainant that he may contact An Coimisinéir Teanga about the language scheme and any contravention of same.

# 2/2019 Unauthorised disclosure of mobile phone e-billing records, containing personal data, by a telecommunications company, to the data subject’s former employer

**(Applicable law: Data Protection Acts 1988 and 2003 (“the Acts”))** 

## Background

The complainant, during a previous employment, asked the telecommunications company to link her personal mobile phone number to her (then) employer’s account. This enabled the complainant to avail of a discount associated with her (then). While this step resulted in the name on the complainant’s account changing to that of her (then) employer, the complainant’s home address remained associated with the account and the complainant remained responsible for payment of any bills.

Following termination of the employment relationship, the complainant contacted the telecommunications company to ask that it (i) restrict her former employer’s access to her mobile phone records; and (ii) separate the account from that of her former employer. Following this request, an account manager took a number of steps in the mistaken belief that this would result in the separation of the complainant’s account from that of her former employer. The complainant, however, became aware that, subsequent to her request, her former employer continued to access her account records. On foot of further inquiries from the complainant, the telecommunications company discovered its error and the complainant’s account was eventually separated from that of her former employer.

The complainant subsequently submitted a complaint to the telecommunications company. Having investigated the complaint, the company informed the complainant that it did not have a record of the original account restriction request. In the circumstances, the complainant referred a complaint to this office.

## Investigation

 During our investigation, the telecommunications company acknowledged that the initial action taken by its account manager was insufficient as it did not separate the complainant’s account from that of her former employer and neither did it prevent her former employer from accessing her e-billing records. The company further acknowledged that its records were incomplete when it investigated the complainant’s complaint. It confirmed, in this regard, that it had since located the complainant’s initial restriction/separation request.

The issues for determination, therefore, were whether the telecommunication company, as data controller:

1. implemented appropriate security measures, having regard to Sections 2(1)(d) and 2C(1) of the acts in order to protect the complainant’s personal data against unauthorised access by, and disclosure to, a third party (i.e. the complainant’s former employer); and
2. kept the complainant’s data accurate, complete and up to date, as required by Section 2(1)(b) of the Acts.

## Appropriate Security Measures

This office found that the telecommunications company did not implement appropriate security measures to protect the complainant’s personal data from unauthorised access by, and disclosure to, her former employer. This was self-evident from the fact that the complainant’s former employer continued to access her e-billing records despite the initial actions taken by the telecommunications company.

This office further noted the obligation, set out in Section 2C(2) of the Acts, for a data controller to “… take all reasonable steps to ensure that — (a) persons employed by him or her … are aware of and comply with the relevant security measures aforesaid …”. This office found that the telecommunications company had not complied with its obligations in this regard. Again, this was self-evident from the fact that the account manager who initially actioned the complainant’s request was operating on the mistaken belief that the actions taken were sufficient to achieve separation of the complainant’s account from that of her
former employer.  

## Accurate, complete and up to date

This office also considered the fact that, at the time when the complainant referred her complaint to the telecommunications company, the company could not locate her initial account restriction request. The result of this was that the outcome of the company’s own investigation into the individual’s complaint was incorrect. Accordingly, and notwithstanding the subsequent rectification of the
position, this office found that the telecommunications company failed to comply with its obligations under Section 2(1)(b) of the Acts in circumstances where the
complainant’s records, at the relevant time, were inaccurate, incomplete and not up to date  

## Key Takeaways
The above case study highlights the fact that the obligation to keep personal data safe and secure is an ongoing one. Data controllers must ensure that they continuously monitor and assess the effectiveness of their security measures, taking account of the possibility that the circumstances or arrangements surrounding its data processing activities may change from time to time. In this case, the data controller failed to take the required action to reflect the change in circumstances that was notified to it by the complainant when she requested the restriction and separation of her account from that of her former employer. The case study further highlights the importance of effective training for employees in relation to any internal protocols.

# 3/2019 Reliance on consent in the use of child’s photograph in the form of promotional material by a State Agency

**(Applicable law — Data Protection Acts 1988 and 2003)  **

We received a complaint from a parent in respect of their child. The parent had
attended a festival organised by a state agency with their child, where a  professional photographer took the child’s photograph. The following year the state agency used this photograph in promotional material. The child’s parent, while accepting that they had conversed with the photographer, had understood at the time of the photograph that they would be contacted prior to any use of the image.  

During the investigation, the state agency indicated that they had relied upon consent pursuant to section 2A(1) (a) of the Acts as the photographer had obtained verbal permission from the child’s parent. However, the state agency also accepted that it was not clear to the child’s parent that the image would be used for media/PR purposes. The state agency further accepted that the parent
was not adequately informed regarding the retention of the image. The DPC welcomed the state agency’s indications that it would immediately review their practices and procedures.

In conclusion, the DPC found that the state agency had not provided the child’s parent with adequate information in order to consent to the processing of the image used in promotional material.
<div style="page-break-after: always; break-after: page;"></div>
# 4/2019 Receivers and fair processing

We received a complaint against a private receiver who was appointed by a
financial institution over the complainant’s property.  

The complaint alleged infringements of the Acts on the basis that the receiver:

- was not registered as a controller pursuant to section 16 of the Acts;
- had no lawful basis for obtaining the complainant’s personal data from the financial institution;
- further processed personal data unlawfully by disclosing information to a company appointed by the receiver to manage the receivership (the receiver’s “managing agent”);
- opened a bank account in the complainant’s name;
- obtained the property ID and PIN from Revenue which gave the receiver access to the complainant’s personal online Revenue account; and
- insured the property in the complainant’s name  

Following an investigation pursuant to section 10 of the Acts, the DPC established that the receiver was appointed by the financial institution on foot of a Deed of Appointment of Receiver (DOA) which granted the receiver powers pursuant to the Conveyancing Act 1881, and pursuant to the mortgage deed between the complainant and the financial institution. On being appointed, the
receiver wrote to the complainant informing them of their appointment as the receiver over the complainant’s property and provided a copy of the DOA. The receiver appointed a separate company as their managing agent to assist in the managing of the property. During the receivership, the receiver liaised with Revenue in order to pay any outstanding taxes on the property, such as the
Local Property Tax (LPT). It was also established that the receiver opened a bank account for the purpose of managing the income from the property. The bank account name included the name of the complainant. It was further established that an insurance policy was taken out, in respect of the property. This insurance policy referred to the complainant’s name.

The DPC first considered whether a receiver was required to register as a data controller in accordance with section 16 the Acts, and whether the exemptions listed in the Data Protection Act 1988 (Section 16(1)) Regulations 2007 (the “Registration Regulations”) applied. The DPC held that a receiver was not required to register, as the exemption under regulation 3(1)(g) of the Registration Regulations applied to the receiver. Regulation 3(1)(g) exempted data controllers who were processing data in relation to its customers. Having considered the relationship between the complainant and the receiver, the DPC held that the exemption applied in respect of the receiver’s activities regarding the complainant.

Next the DPC considered whether the receiver had a lawful basis for obtaining the personal data from the financial institution, disclosing it to the managing agent, and whether such processing constituted further processing incompatible with the original purpose it was obtained pursuant to section 2(1)(c)(ii) of the Acts. The complainant had a mortgage with the financial institution which had fallen into arrears. Under section 19(1)(ii) of the Conveyancing Act 1881, the financial institution could appoint a receiver once the debt on the mortgage had come due. Section 2A(1)(b)(i) of the Acts permits processing of personal data where the processing is necessary “for the performance of a contract to which the data subject is party”. The mortgage deed was a contract between the data subject and the financial institution, and in circumstances where the terms of the contract were not being adhered to, the appointment of the receiver by the financial institution was necessary for the performance of the contact. The DPC held that the receiver had a lawful basis for obtaining the complainant’s personal data from the financial institution.

The DPC also found that the receiver had a lawful basis pursuant to section 2A(1)(b)(i) of the Acts to disclose personal data to its managing agent, to assist in the day to day managing of the receivership. The DPC found that the financial institution obtained the complainant’s personal data for the purposes of entering into a loan agreement. This was specific, explicit and a legitimate purpose. The disclosure of the complainant’s personal data by the financial institution to the receiver, and by the receiver to the managing agent was in accordance with the initial purpose for which the personal data was obtained. This processing during the receivership did not constitute further processing pursuant to section 2(1)(c)(ii) of the Acts.

The DPC assessed whether the receiver had a lawful basis to open a bank account in the complainant’s name. The complainant submitted that this account was opened without their knowledge or consent. Consent is one of the lawful bases for processing personal data under the Acts. The DPC considered whether the receiver otherwise had a lawful basis for processing under section 2A(1)(d) of the Acts, on the basis of legitimate interests. To assess this lawful basis, the DPC took account of the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) case in Rīgas C-13/161 which sets out a three step test for processing on the basis of legitimate interests, as follows  

- the processing of personal data must be for the pursuit of a legitimate interest of the controller or a third party;
- the processing must be necessary for the purpose and legitimate interests pursued; and
- the fundamental rights and freedoms of the individual concerned do not take precedence.

The DPC held that the opening of the bank account was a reasonable measure to manage the income and expenditure during a receivership. The receiver submitted that referring to complainant’s name as part of the bank account name was necessary to ensure the receivership was carried out efficiently and to avoid confusion between different receiverships. While it would have been possible to open an account without using the complainant’s name, the DPC took account of the CJEU’s judgment in Huber v Bundesrepublik C-524/062 where the Court held that processing could be considered necessary where it allowed the relevant objective to be more effectively achieved. The DPC held that the reference to the complainant’s name on the bank account was therefore necessary, as it allowed for the more effective pursuit of the receiver’s legitimate interests.

With regard the third element of the legitimate interests test (which requires a balancing exercise, taking into account the fundamental rights and freedoms of the data subject) the DPC held that the reference to the complainant’s name on the account would have identified them to individuals who had access to the bank account or been supplied with the bank account name. The DPC balanced these concerns against the administrative and financial costs which would result from the need for the receiver to implement an alternative procedure for naming accounts. On balance, the DPC did not find that the complainant’s fundamental rights took precedence over the legitimate interests of the receiver and as a result, the receiver had a lawful basis for processing the complainant’s name, for the purpose of the receiver’s legitimate interests.

With regard to the allegation that the receiver had gained access to the personal Revenue account of the complainant, the DPC found that the receiver did not gain access to the complainant’s personal online Revenue account as alleged. The receiver was acting as a tax agent in relation to the LPT and this did not allow access to a personal Revenue account. In relation to the insurance policy being taken out in the complainant’s name the DPC held that the receiver did not process personal data in this instance.

*[The processing of personal data was considered in a similar case where the same complainant made a complaint against the managing agent in this case. In that decision the DPC held that the managing agent had legitimate interest in processing the complainant’s personal data for the purposes of insuring the property]*

During the course of the investigation the DPC also examined whether the receiver had complied with the data protection principles under section 2 of the Acts. In this regard, the DPC examined the initial correspondence the receiver had sent to the complainant notifying them of their appointment. This correspondence consisted of a cover letter and a copy of the DOA. The cover letter and DOA were assessed in order to determine whether the receiver had met their obligation to process the personal data fairly. Section 2D of the Acts required an organisation in control of personal data to provide information on the identity of the data controller, information on the intended purposes for which the data may be processed, the categories of the data concerned as well as any other information necessary to enable fair processing. The DPC held that the correspondence was sufficient in informing the complainant of the identity of the data controller (and original data controller). However, the DPC held that, while a receiver was not required to provide granular information on each purpose for which personal data was to be processed, the receiver should have given a broad outline of the purposes for which the personal data was intended to be processed, and this was not done in this case. It was also held that the receiver should have provided the categories of personal data they held in relation to the complainant, but this was not done. In light of this, the DPC held that the receiver had not complied with section 2D of the Acts.

This decision of the DPC demonstrates that private receivers and their agents may lawfully process personal data of borrowers, where such processing is necessary in order to manage and realise secured assets. Individuals should be aware that their information may be processed without their consent in circumstances where a deed of mortgage provides for the appointment of a receiver. At the same time, receivers must comply with their obligations under the Acts and GDPR to provide individuals with information on processing at the outset of the receivership.

The decision is currently the subject of an appeal by the complainant to the Circuit Court.

# 5/2019 Prosecution of Vodafone Ireland Limited  

In April 2019 the DPC received two separate complaints from an individual who had received unsolicited direct marketing communications by text and by email from the mobile network operator Vodafone. The individual stated that Vodafone had ignored their customer preference settings, which recorded that they did not wish to receive such marketing.  

During our investigation, Vodafone confirmed that the complainant had been opted-out of direct marketing contact but that communications were sent to them due to human error in the case of both the text message and the email marketing campaigns.

In the case of the SMS message, Vodafone confirmed that a text offering recipients the chance to win tickets to an Ireland v France rugby match was sent to approximately 2,436 customers who had previously opted-out of receiving direct marketing by text. This was as a result of a failure to apply a marketing preferences filter to the SMS advertising campaign before it was sent. 

In the case of the email received by the complainant, an application that was intended to be used to send direct marketing to prospective customers was used in error and the message was sent to existing Vodafone customers. While Vodafone was unable to definitively confirm the number of customers who were contacted by email contrary to their preference, the marketing email was sent to 29,289 existing Vodafone customers. The company confirmed that some 2,523 out of 7,615 of these were contacted in error. However, it was unable to link the remaining 21,674 customers who were sent the same email with their marketing preferences in Vodafone’s data warehouse to confirm the total number contacted in error.

The DPC had also received a separate complaint in February 2019 from another individual who was a former customer of Vodafone. This customer had ceased to be a Vodafone customer more than five years earlier and they still continued to receive promotional text messages. In the course of our investigation, Vodafone confirmed that the direct marketing messages were sent to the complainant in error. It said that in this exceptional case, the complainant’s mobile number was not removed from the platform used to send marketing communications when their number was no longer active on the network. 

As the DPC had previously prosecuted Vodafone in 2011, 2013 and 2018 in relation to direct electronic marketing offences, we decided to initiate prosecution proceedings in relation to these complaints.

At Dublin Metropolitan District Court on 29 July 2019, Vodafone pleaded guilty to five charges of sending unsolicited direct marketing communications in contravention of S.I. No. 336 of 2011 (‘the ePrivacy Regulations’). The company was convicted and fined €1,000 on each of three charges and convicted and fined €750 each in respect of the two remaining charges.  
<div style="page-break-after: always; break-after: page;"></div>
# 6/2019 Prosecution of Just-Eat Ireland Limited

We received a complaint from an individual in November 2018 regarding unsolicited direct marketing emails from Just-Eat Ireland Limited. The complainant had unsubscribed from the company’s direct marketing emails but several days later received an unsolicited marketing email. During our investigation of this complaint the company informed us that the complainant’s attempt to unsubscribe was unsuccessful due to a technical issue with its email platform. This issue affected 391 customers in Ireland. 

As Just-Eat Ireland Limited had previously been warned by the DPC in 2013 on foot of complaints in relation to unsolicited direct marketing emails, we decided to initiate prosecution proceedings.

At Dublin Metropolitan District Court on 29 July 2019, JustEat Ireland Limited pleaded guilty to one charge in relation to sending an unsolicited direct marketing email. The court applied section 1(1) of the Probation of Offenders Act in lieu of a conviction and fine on the basis that the company donate €600 to the Peter McVerry Trust charity.



# 7/2019 Prosecution of Cari's Closet Limited

In May 2018, we received a complaint against the online fashion retailer Cari’s Closet from an individual who had in the past placed an online order with the company. The complaint concerned the receipt of three unsolicited direct marketing emails. The same person had previously complained to the DPC in January 2018 about unsolicited emails from that company. On that occasion, the complainant said they had received over forty marketing emails in one month alone. The person had attempted, without success, to unsubscribe on a couple of occasions.  

Cari’s Closet attributed the failure to properly unsubscribe the complainant from emails to a genuine mistake on its behalf.

As the DPC had issued a warning in April 2018 in relation to the earlier complaint, we decided to initiate prosecution proceedings against the company.

At Dublin Metropolitan District Court on 29 July 2019, Cari’s Closet pleaded guilty to one charge of sending an unsolicited direct marketing email to the complainant. In lieu of a conviction and fine, the court applied section 1(1) of the Probation of Offenders Act on the basis that the company donate €600 to the Little Flower Penny Dinners charity.  
<div style="page-break-after: always; break-after: page;"></div>
# 8/2019 Prosecution of Shop Direct Ireland Limited t/a Littlewoods Ireland  

In May 2019, the DPC received a complaint from an individual who said they had been receiving direct marketing text messages from Littlewoods since March. The complainant stated that they had followed the instructions to unsubscribe by texting the word ‘STOP’ on five occasions to a  designated number known as a short code, but they had not succeeded in opting out and they continued to get marketing text messages.  

In the course of our investigations, Shop Direct Ireland Limited (t/a Littlewoods Ireland) confirmed it had a record of the complainant’s opt-out from direct marketing texts submitted through their account settings on the Littlewoods website on 8 May 2019. It did not, however, have a record of their attempts to opt-out of direct marketing texts on previous occasions using the SMS short code.

This was due to human error in setting up the content for the SMS marketing messages. The company said that the individual responsible for preparing and uploading content relating to marketing texts had mistakenly included the opt-out keyword ‘STOP’ instead of ‘LWISTOP’ at the end of the marketing texts.

Shop Direct Ireland Limited had previously been prosecuted by the DPC in 2016 in relation to a similar issue which resulted in a customer attempting, without success, to unsubscribe from direct marketing emails. On that occasion, the court outcome resulted in the company making a donation of €5,000 to charity in lieu of a conviction and fine.

The DPC decided to prosecute the company in respect of direct electronic marketing offences in relation to the May 2019 complaint.

At Dublin Metropolitan District Court on 29 July 2019, Shop Direct Ireland Limited (t/a Littlewoods Ireland) entered guilty pleas to two charges relating to sending unsolicited direct marketing text messages. The court ruled that the company would be spared a conviction and fine if it donated €2,000 each to the Peter McVerry Trust and the Little Flower Penny Dinners charities and section 1(1) of the Probation of Offenders Act was applied.  
<div style="page-break-after: always; break-after: page;"></div>
# 9/2019 HSE Hospital/Healthcare Agency  

In 2019, the DPC received a complaint about the disclosure of a patient’s data via Facebook messenger by a hospital porter regarding her attendance at the Early Pregnancy Unit of a hospital. Upon examination of the complaint, the HSE clarified to the DPC that the hospital porter who disclosed the personal information of the patient was in fact employed by a healthcare agency contracted by the HSE. The DPC contacted the agency and sought an update in relation to its internal investigation, details of any remedial action as well as details of any disciplinary action taken against the employee in question. At the same time, the DPC advised the HSE that, as it contracts the company concerned to provide agency staff to work in the hospital, ultimately the HSE is the data controller for the personal data in this instance. 

The complaint was subsequently withdrawn by the solicitor acting on behalf of the woman following a settlement being agreed between the affected party and the hospital/healthcare agency. Data controllers/data processors may be liable under Section 117 of the Data Protection Act 2018 to an individual for damages if they fail to observe the duty of care they owe in relation to personal data in their possession.

The DPC has no role whatsoever in dealing with compensation claims and no function in relation to the taking of any such proceedings under Section 117 of the 2018 Act or in the provision of any such legal advice.

What this case illustrates is that ongoing training is necessary for all staff in relation to their obligations under data protection law and that controllers must do due diligence and satisfy themselves that any contractors/processors they engage are fully trained and prepared to comply with data protection laws.
<div style="page-break-after: always; break-after: page;"></div>
# 10/2019 Loss of control of paper files  

A public sector health service provider notified the DPC that a number of files containing patient medical information had been found in a storage cabinet on a hospital premises which was no longer occupied.

The records were discovered by a person who had gained illegally accessed a restricted premises and subsequently posted photographs of the cabinet containing the files on social media. The public sector organisation in question informed the DPC that, having become aware of the breach, a representative of the organisation was sent to locate and secure the files. The files were removed from the premises and secured.

This breach highlights the importance of having appropriate records management policies; including mechanisms for tracking files, appropriate secure storage facilities and full procedures for the retention or deletion of records. 

The DPC issued a number of recommendations to the organisations to improve their personal data processing practices.



# 11/2019 Ransomware Attack

An organisation operating in the leisure industry notified the DPC that it had been the victim of a ransomware attack which potentially encrypted/disclosed the personal data of up to 500 customers and staff stored on the organisations server. The route of the infiltration was traced to a modem router that had been compromised (back up data was however stored securely via a cloud server).  

Following examination of the incident, the DPC issued a number of recommendations to the organisation. The DPC recommended that the organisation conduct an analysis of its ICT infrastructure to establish if further malware was present, to review and implement appropriate measures to ensure there is an adequate level of security surrounding the processing of personal data, and to conduct employee training to encompass cyber security risks.

The DPC has received regular updates from the organisation and is satisfied that significant steps to improve and implement both organisational and technical measures concerning shortfalls in the security of their ICT infrastructure have been taken, including the development of a training plan for all staff in this area.
<div style="page-break-after: always; break-after: page;"></div>
# 12/2019 Disclosure of CCTV footage via social media  

A commercial and residential property management company notified the DPC that an employee of a security company whose services they retained had used their personal mobile phone to record CCTV footage of two members of the public engaged in an intimate act, which had been captured by the management company’s security cameras.  

The video taken was subsequently shared via WhatsApp to a limited number of individuals. The business advised the DPC that they communicated to staff who may have received the footage that they must delete it and requested no further dissemination of the video.

Both the property management company and the security company were able to demonstrate that adequate policies and procedures did exist, however appropriate oversight and supervision to ensure compliance with these policies and procedures were lacking.

Following recommendations made by the DPC to the property management company, the company has subsequently engaged with its staff to deliver further data protection training with an emphasis on personal data breaches. In addition, further signage was displayed prohibiting the use of personal mobile devices within the confines of the CCTV control room.
<div style="page-break-after: always; break-after: page;"></div>
# 13/2019  Proposals for Fraud Sharing Databases  

The first proposal from Insurance Ireland is to expand an existing database, called InsuranceLink, to include additional data fields. InsuranceLink contains details of insurance claims made by individuals to facilitate the exchange of information between insurance companies when a claim for compensation has been made by a customer for the purpose of identifying fraud where false claims are being potentially processed. One of the proposed additional data sets is third party personal data such as witnesses to accidents.

The second proposal was from Banking and Payments Federation Ireland (BPFI) on behalf of the main retail banks, who wish to create a fraud information-sharing database that would be operated by an independent trusted third party. Each bank that establishes fraudulent activity would, according to predefined rules, transmit that information to the database and all participant banks would be permitted to check client details against the database for the purposes of identifying and preventing fraud. 

The DPC has emphasised to both Insurance Ireland and BPFI that industry fraud databases, involving the processing of significant volumes of sensitive data, must meet necessity and proportionality requirements under EU law and jurisprudence. We have also emphasised that the operation of each database must, as necessary, have a statutory underpinning to ensure compliance with data protection obligations under the GDPR and the Data Protection Act 2018, such as, for example, where the processing is in the public interest and/or involves data relating to offences or alleged offences.

It is the DPC’s view that both proposals raise significant risks for individuals, in particular to persons who may be wrongly identified as participating in fraudulent activity, or, in the case of insurance claims, to persons who are not directly linked to a claim such as a witness. We have advised the parties that these risks must be fully assessed and mitigated, including by building in very robust safeguards, rules and procedures and ensuring that the principles of data protection such as data minimisation are complied with. Furthermore, we have highlighted the importance of public consultation and awareness on the scope and purpose of these proposals.
